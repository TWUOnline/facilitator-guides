# **Facilitator’s Guide for PHIL 210**

This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies for synchronous sessions, and instructor notes. Please also review the course contents in Moodle. All assignments and learning activities for each unit are explained in detail, and this guide is meant to supplement the information found in the Moodle course.

Before you begin, read through the Course Introduction in Moodle, including the course description, learning outcomes, and assessment overview.

# **Course Format**

PHIL 210 is a self-paced, asynchronous course, which means the entire course content will be delivered through the Moodle site. In a self-paced course, learners must experience, reflect, theorise and test new knowledge in order to learn, and then practice evaluative judgement, in which they assess the quality of their own work. Learners need to engage critically with course content and build research skills and writing skills in order to successfully complete the assessment in this course. Learners are encouraged to submit assignments by weeks 2, 4, and 6, as well as participate in ungraded discussion forums and self-check quizzes. The online setting is well designed for the self-motivated learner who can manage their own time effectively. Students are also encouraged to participate in the Online Learning Hub led by TWU Facilitators. These are key sessions that will involve learning activities in preparation for the assessment in GX courses.

|------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Assignment**               | **Value** | **Connection to SLOs** |
| Reflective Journal           | 30%       | 1, 5, 6                |
| Ethics Committee Responses   | 30%       | 1, 2, 3, 5             |

| Total                        | 100       |                        |

## Assignment 1: Reflective Journal (30% of total grade)

For the reflective journal, base your comments around a few key ideas from the course text reading of Units 1 & 2 and follow these steps:

- First pick out and explain 1-2 key ideas (terms, concepts, analogies, viewpoints) expressed in the text, etc. Show you understand them.

- Second, concisely state the ethical question related to one of these concepts.

- Third, give your own reflections on them. Here are some suggestions for how to do that:

  - Which viewpoint do you agree with? Why? Give at least one reason for your view.

  - Do you find the issue especially. difficult, or quite straightforward? Why?

  - Do you have any experiences which might provide guidance for you in working through the ethical questions in the text?

**Length:** 250 – 300 words in length.

## Assignment 2: Ethics Committee Responses (15 x 2 = 30%)

Throughout this course, you will work with a group of your peers (groups of 4-5), assuming the role of an Ethics Committee. This committee will meet two times throughout the course to discuss issues and then create a summary report, for a total of 2 Ethics Committee Responses.

Group members work together to produce their report; it is one report created by each group. Read the relevant pages for the unit and then discuss as a group the issue in the reading. Then follow this basic structure for your report:

1.  Begin by **<u>stating concisely the ethical issue, question, dilemma, or case</u>** you are addressing as a committee. A case study will be assigned to you by the course facilitator. You will respond to the question in each case study for this assignment. Suggested wording to begin your report is the following: “The issue we are addressing in this report is. . .”

2.  Then give a brief **<u>explanation of the case</u>** to show you understand it.

3.  Then state **<u>your recommendation AS A COMMITTEE</u>**. Do not use “I” in this report. Use “we” since the report is the recommendation of the whole committee after discussing it.

4.  Concisely state **<u>WHY you recommend this</u>**. “We recommend this course of action because ...” If possible, connect your recommendation to one of the ethical approaches covered in the course text.

<span class="mark">Each report is worth 15%, for a total of 30% of your course grade. You will complete an Ethics Committee Response for Units 3 and 4.</span>

<span class="mark">Length: 350-500 words.</span>

## 

## Assignment 3: <span class="mark">Partner Presentation Project (40%)</span>

For this presentation, you and one other student will prepare a 10–12-minute video in which you will address one of the ethical issues covered in the course.

Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion project. Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and include the following elements:

> ● Explanation of the ethical dilemma you will address,
>
> ● Background information to educate your audience on this issue,
>
> ● Definitions of key terms related to your issue,
>
> ● Thesis statement which sets out the viewpoint you will argue for,
>
> ● Supporting arguments for your viewpoint,
>
> ● Response to at least one objection to your viewpoint.

**Presentations are visual representations of ideas, concepts, innovations, plans, or solutions. As such they need to be appealing to keep the interest of the audience. In order to produce good presentations, the following key factors should be considered:**

1.  Presentations should not be read from a paper. Writing a technical report or paper is a different medium of communication than presenting orally. The goal of a presentation is to get a few key points across to an audience, not to overwhelm people with details.

<!-- -->

2.  Presentations must be visually appealing. Interspersing pictures, video, graphics, charts, tables all help to keep the listener engaged in the presentation.

3.  Presentations must be succinct. It is wise to economize your words and make each point as concisely and clearly as possible.

<!-- -->

4.  Presentations must be compelling through story. Try to present in such a way that your class colleagues will connect to the issue, problem, solution or opportunity that you are presenting.

5.  Both presenters should be involved in the presentation. You are encouraged to go through your presentation one or two times before presenting it to the class.

**GRADING CRITERIA FOR PARTNER PRESENTATION**

The six required elements of the presentation mentioned above are the following:

> ● Explanation of the ethical dilemma you will address,
>
> ● Background information to educate your audience on this issue,
>
> ● Definitions of key terms related to your issue,
>
> ● Thesis statement which sets out the viewpoint you will argue for,
>
> ● Supporting arguments for your viewpoint,
>
> ● Response to at least one objection to your viewpoint.

**Grade A:** All 6 required elements are included and are presented with excellence.

Grade B: All 6 required elements are included and there is room for minor improvements in 2 or more of them.

Grade C: 1 required element is missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in 2 or more of them.

Grade D: 2 or more required elements are missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in 3 or more of them.

Grade F: 3 or more required elements are missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in the material that is presented.

**Assignment Submission**

> Partner Project will be presented on Unit 5 & 6 in the lab session
