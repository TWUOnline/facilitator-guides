# **Facilitator’s Guide for PHIL 210- 6 Weeks**


This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies for synchronous sessions, and instructor notes. Please also review the course contents in Moodle. All assignments and learning activities for each unit are explained in detail, and this guide is meant to supplement the information found in the Moodle course.

Before you begin, read through the Course Introduction in Moodle, including the course description, learning outcomes, and assessment overview.

# **Course Format**

PHIL 210 is a self-paced, asynchronous course, which means the entire course content will be delivered through the Moodle site. In a self-paced course, learners must experience, reflect, theorise and test new knowledge in order to learn, and then practice evaluative judgement, in which they assess the quality of their own work. Learners need to engage critically with course content and build research skills and writing skills in order to successfully complete the assessment in this course. Learners are encouraged to submit assignments by weeks 2, 4, and 6, as well as participate in ungraded discussion forums and self-check quizzes. The online setting is well designed for the self-motivated learner who can manage their own time effectively. Students are also encouraged to participate in the Online Learning Hub led by TWU Facilitators. These are key sessions that will involve learning activities in preparation for the assessment in GX courses.

# **Assessment**

# **Graded Assignments** 

**Please see the Assessment tab for more details.** Here is a brief overview:

|                              |           |                        |
|------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Assignment**               | **Value** | **Connection to SLOs** |
| Reflective Journal           | 30%       | 1, 5, 6                |
| Ethics Committee Responses   | 30%       | 1, 2, 3, 5             |
| Partner Project Presentation | 40%       | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5          |
| Total                        | 100       |                        |

## Assignment 1: Reflective Journal (30% of total grade)

For the reflective journal, base your comments around a few key ideas from the course text reading of Units 1 & 2 and follow these steps:

- First pick out and explain 1-2 key ideas (terms, concepts, analogies, viewpoints) expressed in the text, etc. Show you understand them.

- Second, concisely state the ethical question related to one of these concepts.

- Third, give your own reflections on them. Here are some suggestions for how to do that:

  - Which viewpoint do you agree with? Why? Give at least one reason for your view.

  - Do you find the issue especially. difficult, or quite straightforward? Why?

  - Do you have any experiences which might provide guidance for you in working through the ethical questions in the text?

**Length:** 250 – 300 words in length.

## Assignment 2: Ethics Committee Responses (15 x 2 = 30%)

Throughout this course, you will work with a group of your peers (groups of 4-5), assuming the role of an Ethics Committee. This committee will meet two times throughout the course to discuss issues and then create a summary report, for a total of 2 Ethics Committee Responses.

Group members work together to produce their report; it is one report created by each group. Read the relevant pages for the unit and then discuss as a group the issue in the reading. Then follow this basic structure for your report:

1.  Begin by **<u>stating concisely the ethical issue, question, dilemma, or case</u>** you are addressing as a committee. A case study will be assigned to you by the course facilitator. You will respond to the question in each case study for this assignment. Suggested wording to begin your report is the following: “The issue we are addressing in this report is. . .”

2.  Then give a brief **<u>explanation of the case</u>** to show you understand it.

3.  Then state **<u>your recommendation AS A COMMITTEE</u>**. Do not use “I” in this report. Use “we” since the report is the recommendation of the whole committee after discussing it.

4.  Concisely state **<u>WHY you recommend this</u>**. “We recommend this course of action because ...” If possible, connect your recommendation to one of the ethical approaches covered in the course text.

<span class="mark">Each report is worth 15%, for a total of 30% of your course grade. You will complete an Ethics Committee Response for Units 3 and 4.</span>

<span class="mark">Length: 350-500 words.</span>

## 

## Assignment 3: <span class="mark">Partner Presentation Project (40%)</span>

For this presentation, you and one other student will prepare a 10–12-minute video in which you will address one of the ethical issues covered in the course.

Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion project. Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and include the following elements:

> ● Explanation of the ethical dilemma you will address,
>
> ● Background information to educate your audience on this issue,
>
> ● Definitions of key terms related to your issue,
>
> ● Thesis statement which sets out the viewpoint you will argue for,
>
> ● Supporting arguments for your viewpoint,
>
> ● Response to at least one objection to your viewpoint.

**Presentations are visual representations of ideas, concepts, innovations, plans, or solutions. As such they need to be appealing to keep the interest of the audience. In order to produce good presentations, the following key factors should be considered:**

1.  Presentations should not be read from a paper. Writing a technical report or paper is a different medium of communication than presenting orally. The goal of a presentation is to get a few key points across to an audience, not to overwhelm people with details.

<!-- -->

2.  Presentations must be visually appealing. Interspersing pictures, video, graphics, charts, tables all help to keep the listener engaged in the presentation.

3.  Presentations must be succinct. It is wise to economize your words and make each point as concisely and clearly as possible.

<!-- -->

4.  Presentations must be compelling through story. Try to present in such a way that your class colleagues will connect to the issue, problem, solution or opportunity that you are presenting.

5.  Both presenters should be involved in the presentation. You are encouraged to go through your presentation one or two times before presenting it to the class.

**GRADING CRITERIA FOR PARTNER PRESENTATION**

The six required elements of the presentation mentioned above are the following:

> ● Explanation of the ethical dilemma you will address,
>
> ● Background information to educate your audience on this issue,
>
> ● Definitions of key terms related to your issue,
>
> ● Thesis statement which sets out the viewpoint you will argue for,
>
> ● Supporting arguments for your viewpoint,
>
> ● Response to at least one objection to your viewpoint.

**Grade A:** All 6 required elements are included and are presented with excellence.

Grade B: All 6 required elements are included and there is room for minor improvements in 2 or more of them.

Grade C: 1 required element is missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in 2 or more of them.

Grade D: 2 or more required elements are missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in 3 or more of them.

Grade F: 3 or more required elements are missing and/or there is room for substantial improvements in the material that is presented.

## Session 1: PHIL 210 - SMART goals for academic success
Student Learning Outcome: At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the importance of setting goals to succeed academically.
- Discover their unique motivation to learn.
- Develop personal goals for completing the LDRS 591 course using the SMART model.

3.	Explain the Labs duration and one-on-one sessions.
4.	Provide a brief overview of the session outline, including the lesson’s outcomes and learning activities.

**Ice Breaker**

One of the ways to incorporate an inclusive facilitation approach is to integrate relationship-building activities, thus fostering the development of a sense of community among students (Samuels, 2018). This activity allows participants to know one another by learning interesting facts about their peers in a small-group setting 

**Activity Description**

Truth and Lie (Campbell, 2016): Arraange the participants into groups of four people. Instruct them to write down two truths and one lie about themselves. The lie should be believable to some extent. Then, one at a time, they will read the truths and lie in random order. When finished, the team should discuss what they think are truths and lies (5 min).

**Course Introduction**

**Introduction**

How do you call a soccer game with no goals? (pointless)
What a game with no clear directions is called? (a waste of time)
How would you call a bus with no clear destination? (lost)
As you start your journey this semester, I want to encourage you to have clear goals to achieve your destination.
Now, sometimes we make plans, and we wish a smooth journey. However, what we usually experience is a bumby journey.

**Learning Activity 1**

Briefly explain the learning activity.
1-2-4-All (Lipmanowicz & McCandless, n.d.): 
1.	Start by asking the following question: What strategies can you think of to help you push through amid discouraging situations, such as receiving low grades, missing an assignment due date, and so on? 
2.	Each student begins by quietly reflecting on the questions (2 min).
3.	Then, pair the students to build on the ideas from their self-reflection (3 min).
4.	Create groups of four and allow the participants to develop ideas from the solutions discussed in pairs (5 min).
Use the “Wheel of Names” (https://wheelofnames.com/) to randomly select five groups to give feedback on their answers and experience (5 min). Discuss the activity with the group (7 min).

## Unit 1: The Nature of Moral Inquiry

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

 In your country, what do people usually have for breakfast? (5 min)

**Unit 1 Introduction to Worldview:**

What is a Worldview? (5 min)

Sire (2015) explains this relationship between our conscious and subconscious minds as follows: “We think with our worldview and because of our worldview, not about our worldview” (p. 143). Hence, a worldview is like a pair of glasses we subconsciously wear, colouring, shaping, and directing the way we see and interact with the world. 
What are the elements forming our worldview?
How can a person’s worldview influence their morality?

**Learning Activity 1:**

Explain some unique features of moral discourse: Play the Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOoffXFpAlU&t=9s (3 min + 10 min groups + 10 min presentations).Did the Burglar do a good thing? Is he a hero for saving the woman’s life even though he did not intend to help her? Should he be arrested even though he did not steal anything?

**Learning Activity 2:** 

Defining Terms:	Do an online search and find a picture, a slide, or create a table that explains the definition of (10 min + 5 min).

Group1: metaethics and normative ethics.
Group2: cultural relativism and moral objectivism.
Group3: applied ethics and moral intuition

**Ethics Committee Assignment**	

- Make sure people have groups
- Explain the Assignment. Submission Details: due date, Word Doc, by email.

**Reminders**

1. Complete Unit 1 and start Unit 2.

## Unit 2: Moral Objectivism vs. Subjectivism

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**	

Share one interesting aspect of your culture (5 min).

**Revision Unit 1:	Kahoot! (10 min)**

**Introduction Unit 2**

Ethics has its key terms; we will turn our attention to some of the most important ones in this unit. The terms we will examine convey important ethical concepts, the ones we need to understand to carry out a proper ethical inquiry. Once we have a clear working knowledge of them, we will be able to reflect on where we stand on the issues they raise. The positions we take on these concepts will greatly influence how we think about all ethical questions and dilemmas we face (2 min).

**Activity 1**

Definition of important Terms (10 min + 5 min presentation)

## Unit 3:  Why Be Moral?

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

 If money was not an issue, where would you be right now?

**Revision Unit 2:Kahoot! (10 min)**

**Introduction Unit 3**

Suppose you learn that a colleague at work is overcharging for certain items and keeping the extra money. You, being an honest and loyal employee, immediately take him aside and tell him to stop, reminding him that his actions are not only harmful to the company and against policies, but they are simply immoral. To your surprise, your colleague answers, “What I’m doing is harmless. The company is big enough that no one will even notice. I agree it’s immoral but why should I care about being moral?” Unit 3 brings up this question “Why be moral?” And this is the topic we will be discussing today (2 min)

## Unit 4: How to Determine What is Moral?

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

 Tell us how you are feeling today using an emoji or a series of emojis

**Revision Unit 3: Kahoot! (5 min)**

**Introduction** 

Unit 4	Have you ever disagreed with someone over what the correct ethical action or point of view is in a certain situation? For example, would lie to protect someone’s job be acceptable? Would stealing food to feed a starving child be acceptable?
These are difficult ethical dilemmas. Consequently, the question we want to ask ourselves is: 
How can we decide what good ethical behaviour is when we are faced with tough ethical choices? 
In this unit, we will learn three theories of morality that set out answers to this question:  Utilitarianism, The Categorical Imperative, and Justice as Fairness (5 min).

**Justice as Fairness**

By John Rawls holds that the morally good, or just, course of action is the one which is the fairest in the situation. The Original Position is a theory to help people to make decisions based on fairness and not on interest.

**Utilitarianism**

John Stuart Mill was a supporter of Utilitarianism, which teaches that morally good actions are those that, on balance, bring about the greatest good or happiness in any given situation.

**The Categorical Imperative**
Immanuel Kant stated that the morality of any action does not depend on its consequences or effects. Rather, he said, the morality of an action depends upon whether it fulfills our duty to follow ethical rules.

**Activity 1**

Watch a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLInfO_iLNg&t=42s (15 min)

**The Original Position:**

 John Rawls to create a just society the rules that govern that society must be created by a committee of people who do not know their position in that society. They do not know if they will be rich or poor, black, white, gay, or disabled. While they are trying to design a just society all that knowledge about themselves would be hidden in what Rawls called a “veil of ignorance”. Because if they do, they will act in their self-interest and create rules that benefit them. So, not knowing if they would be the president of a large company or a street cleaner would make them create a society that benefits all; otherwise, they might be the street cleaner.

The Original Position is a theory to help people to make decisions based on fairness and not on interest. What do you think?
Should a committee decide the principles of justice from behind the “veil of ignorance”? Considering the theories of egoism we learned last week; would it be possible for such a committee to exist today in our society?

**Activity 2**

Activity 4.4: Diamond Case Study (Why be Moral?) (20 min prep + 10 min presentations)

Room 1 – Utilitarianism 

Room 2 – Categorical imperative

Room 3 – Original Position

How would each of you say they should be divided? How do each ethical concept, the categorical imperative, the original position, and utilitarianism influence each answer?

## Unit 5: Free Speech and its Limits

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

 Name 2 items you would bring with you if you were stranded on a desert island (10 min). 

**Revision Unit 4: Kahoot! (5 min)**

**In-Class Assignment	Unit 5 – Partner Project Presentations and group discussions (25 min)**

**Introduction**

How far does the right to free speech go? We will see that this question cannot be answered without first establishing the basis for free speech in the first place. Notice that our basis for free speech cannot simply be that the government decrees this right, since the very question at stake is what moral basis governments have doing so. Our readings for this unit will expose us both to a proposed moral foundation for the right to free speech and a case for certain limitations to be placed upon it.

**BREAK (10 min)**

**Group Activity**

Activity 5.3: Controversial Speaker Case Study
In your groups, read and analyze the following case study.
A controversial person is coming to your community planning on giving a public lecture in the community hall.  The event which has been widely publicized has drawn protests from those who are petitioning the organizers to cancel the event.  They argue that this speaker’s views are offensive and should be neither tolerated nor even publicly expressed. From the course readings:
1. Give examples of controversial topics.
2. How do you think John Stuart Mill would respond if he were one of the organizers? 
3. Explain why you believe he would respond this way. Do you agree with him? Why or why not?

## Unit 6: Sexual Morality

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

**Revision Unit 5: Kahoot! (5 min)*

**In-Class Assignment	Unit 6 – Partner Project Presentations and group discussions (25 min)**

**Introduction**

Unit 6 explores sexual morality. You will learn about topics such as date rape. Alcohol & rape, and hook-up culture. For example: If a man gets a woman drunk and then has sex with her, would it count as rape? It would seem so but, then, what precisely constitutes the act of “getting her drunk?” What if she was happy to go along with the drinking?

In these situations, what is the key factor that will determine if someone was raped or not? CONSENT/PERMISSION. To clarify what consent means, let’s watch the video:  https://youtu.be/fGoWLWS4-kU. How can the use of alcohol be connected to rape?

**Group Activity 6.4:** 

Stuck in the Middle Case Study

A long-time friend phones you and tells you she was raped last night on a date with another friend of yours.  When you call the other friend, he is shocked to hear she is using the term, rape. He claims that she led him on and he thought she was “into it.”  After all, they had been drinking and touching throughout the evening at her place. Even though she seemed reluctant at one point, in the end, she went along with it.  It so happens that you have just completed the course reading for this unit so you might be thinking of the complexities of the situation and the individual perspectives of both people.

What questions arise?  What questions should the people involved be asking themselves? What are bound to be the most difficult complicating factors in this discussion?

**Check-in and Icebreaker:**

**Revision Unit 6:Kahoot! (5 min)**

**In-Class Assignment	Unit 7 – Partner Project Presentations and group discussions (25 min)**

**Introduction**

Unit 7 starts with the following question: Do animals have rights? What is a right?

A right conveys the idea of being entitled to something. If a person does not receive something to which they have a right, then a wrong has been done. Their rights have been violated. 

Immanuel Kant, who believed animals do not have rights. Interestingly he tied his answer directly to the question of what kinds of beings have rights. In order to have a right, says Kant, a being must be self-conscious, or in other words, self-aware. Since he believed animals do not have this characteristic, they cannot possess rights.

Peter Singer, who argued that animals do, indeed, have rights, in the same strong sense as we humans have them. Furthermore, since animals have rights, many of our current practices involving animals are immoral. They violate the rights of animals. In fact, Singer went so far as to argue that the very principle of equality which we apply to humans should be extended to many animals as well. He said we are guilty of something he called speciesism when we restrict this principle to humans.

**BREAK (10 min)**

**Introduction**	

Unit 9 covers the topics of torture and terrorism. Torture, in the sense we will use it in this unit, involves inflicting pain or suffering on a person by the state for the purpose of extracting information. The ethical question we will face is whether we are ever morally justified in supporting our governments to carry out this practice.

The questions I want to ask you are:

1.	Are governments ever justified in using torture? 
2.	Are we, as citizens, ever justified in supporting them in using torturous methods?

**BREAK (10 min)**

**Group Activity**

What does JUSTICE mean to you? Justice as retribution is one of the philosophical forces behind capital punishment. Utilitarian philosophers, on the other hand, embrace welfare maximization.  Others, defend restorative justice as means of punishment.

In your groups, you will have 20 minutes to create a 3-minute presentation on the following:

1.	Group 1: defending the justice as retribution view. 
2.	Group 2: defending the welfare maximization view. 
3.	Group 3: defending the restorative justice view. 
In your presentations, start by explaining the philosophical view, state the reasons you agree with it, and end the presentation by asking if anyone has any questions.
