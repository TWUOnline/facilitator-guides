#### Ice Breaker

One of the ways to incorporate an inclusive facilitation approach is to integrate relationship-building activities, thus fostering the development of a sense of community among students (Samuels, 2018). This activity allows participants to know one another by learning fascinating facts about their peers in a small-group setting.
Activity Description Truth and Lie (Campbell, 2016): Divide the participants into groups of four people. Instruct them to write down two truths and one lie about themselves. The lie should be believable to some extent. Then, one at a time, they will read the truths and lie in random order. When finished, the team should discuss what they think are truths and lies (5 min).

#### Introduction

How do you call a soccer game with no goals? (pointless) What is a game with no clear directions called? (a waste of time) How would you call a bus with no clear destination? (lost) As you start your journey this semester, I encourage you to have clear goals to achieve your destination. Now, (show the “journey” picture in the PPT slide) sometimes we make plans, and we wish it would look like this (smooth path). However, it looks like this (bumpy pathway).

#### Learning Activity 1

Briefly explain the learning activity. 1-2-4-All (Lipmanowicz &amp; McCandless, n.d.): Show Students the “Bumpy Road Picture” on the PPT slide. Start by asking the following question: What strategies can you think of to help you push through amid discouraging situations, such as receiving low grades, missing an assignment due date, and so on? Each student begins by quietly reflecting on the questions (2 min). Then, pair the students to build on the ideas from their self-reflection (3 min). Create groups of four and allow the participants to develop ideas from the solutions discussed in pairs (5 min). Use the “Wheel of Names” (<https://wheelofnames.com/>) to randomly select groups to give feedback on their answers and experience (5 min). Discuss the activity with the group (7 min).

#### Unit 1 Introduction to Worldview

What is a worldview? Sire (2015) explains this relationship between our conscious and subconscious minds as follows: “We think with our worldview and because of our worldview, not about our worldview” (p. 143). Hence, a worldview is like a pair of glasses we subconsciously wear, colouring, shaping, and directing how we see and interact with the world. What are the elements forming our worldview? How can a person’s worldview influence their morality?
