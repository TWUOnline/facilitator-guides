**Course Policies:**
--------------------


### Missed Speech Day Policy:


> Please be ready for your scheduled day. If you miss your day for any reason
> besides severe illness or other extenuating circumstances, you will be
> required to speak at the tail end of all other speeches, and you will
> receive an automatic reduction of 15 points. This is a gracious policy
> compared to the consequences of not being ready for a life speech. Please
> contact the Facilitator immediately when you feel you are unable to speak
> (for whatever reason).


### **Long or Short Speech Policy:**


> What happens if you go significantly short or long on your speech? It’s hard
> to provide a cut-and-dry rule because some ‘too short’ speeches are very
> good in all other respects, and some ‘long speeches’ have terrific ‘added
> value.’ But the general rule is that for every one minute short or long, 3
> points are deducted from your score. This respects the cultural expectation
> that speaking events last certain lengths of time, and it guarantees
> everyone who signed up to speak that day is allowed to (i.e., no one gets
> bumped due to three long speakers!)


### Inclusive Classroom:


> TWU is committed to an ethic of inclusion centred on the principles of
> hospitality, reciprocity and reconciliation. We seek to produce generous
> learning spaces that are based on respect for difference and are open to
> diverse views, opinions, and identities. We welcome and value all voices,
> including those that have been silenced on account of race, religious
> beliefs, colour, gender, physical or mental variations, age, ancestry, place
> of origin, marital status, family status, sex, and sexual orientation, or on
> any other grounds identified in applicable human rights law.




### Grading Guidelines


Following is a description of the letter grading:


| **A range = Superior, exceptional, outstanding**. A+ 90-100% A 85-89% A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.** B+ 77-79% B 73-76% B- 70-72% | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors. |
| **C range = Acceptable.** C+ 67-69% C 63-66% C- 60-62% | The assignment demonstrates satisfactory ability to describe overall picture and essential concepts. This means the student has completed the assignment in a manner involving no significant errors. Material may not be free from structural and grammatical errors. Nuanced reasoning is not demonstrated. |
| **D range = Below average**. D+ 57-59% D 53-56% D- 50-52% | The assignment demonstrates reasoning that is neither carefully nuanced nor coherently presented; writing is insufficient in depth of insight and/or use of texts; presentation is not free from material error in structure, spelling and grammar. This means that the student failed to respond adequately to the assignment and its intentions. |
| **F = Unsatisfactory**. F -50% | In one or more of the following ways the student: 1) failed to turn in the assignment; 2) did not respond to the assignment as given; 3) submitted work so thoroughly flawed as to indicate that the student did not make a serious effort, 4) was involved in plagiarism or cheating. |
| |




### Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU


> One of the core values of is the integration of academic excellence with
> high standards of personal, moral, and spiritual integrity. The University
> considers it a serious offence when an individual attempts to gain unearned
> academic credit. It is the student’s responsibility to be informed about
> what constitutes academic dishonesty. For details on this, and on
> identifying and avoiding plagiarism go to page 46 of the Academic Calendar
> (found at <https://www.twu.ca/academics/academic-calendar>).

## Class Activities

The following sections outline key information you will need to plan and facilitate this course.
**Note that once you have mapped out the course (specific units to
dates), send the updated syllabus to the instructor.**


Course Resources
================


- The course textbook is: *A Concise Public Speaking Handbook*, 5th edition.
Students will need to access the text online at:
<https://revel.pearson.com/#/courses/5c657df8e4b0382938d71581/toc>. Students
must have online access initially to get the text, and then the course
materials can be downloaded to a phone/table app if desired.


- IMPORTANT NOTE: The units of this course dovetail well with the chapters of
the assigned textbook. Students must study both the units and the assigned
chapters from the course text. Sometimes the material will overlap, but
often the unit material and the chapter material will support and augment
each other.


- Before you begin each unit, encourage students to skim the sections of the
required chapter. Then, read the unit on Moodle (e.g. topics, learning
activities). Before they complete any unit assessments, they must read the
required chapters in full and do the short quizzes.


- Remind students to take notes! The online text also has useful resources to
help you study. Be sure to watch the videos. This process will reinforce
what they are learning and help them do well in the course.


- Facilitators will have access to the online textbook, in case they want to
make notes, highlight content, etc.


**Online Learning Activities**
==============================


- **Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that
will be discussed that week. They need to read the textbook chapters, the
overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning
activities.**


- **Online learning activities include questions that we ask students to
answer in a Reflective Journal, videos that explain topics further, and an
ungraded key terms quiz.**


- **As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that
they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal
due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor
on Moodle by Friday.**


**In-class Learning Activities**


### **Discussions**


- **In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about.
As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would
inspire an engaging group/class discussion.**


- Students are encouraged to bring their **Reflective Journal** to class, as
it has notes from the online activities. Choose which topics they can share
with partner/group. Encourage them to add reflections to journal after the
class. Point out journal submission dates (after Units 1, 2, 4, 10). 


### **Key Terms Review Activities**


- Units 1, 2, 4, and 5 explain key terms that students need to know for the
midterm. Students are encouraged do quizzes online, but you may want to have
some vocabulary activities or study skills exercises in class (if there is
time).


- Note that there are unit quizzes in Moodle (H5P) as well as the Revel
quizzes (online textbook)



### **Speech Practice:**


- Students will deliver speeches in Units 3, 7, 8. Be sure to give
them at least one class to practice with a partner, and then depending on
your timeline, how many students, etc., you will need to plan out how many
additional classes you will need for the presentations and feedback.


### **Speech Presentations**


#### Timing:


- Speeches in class: Confirm time limits for each speech with Instructor. This
depends on the length of the course, contact hours and number of students.
Average for speeches:


1. Non-graded “ice-breaker” speech: 3-4 minutes (this is optional)


2. Informative Speech: 6-7 minutes with at least 3 reference （this may change due to student number, please double check with Prof Ned）


3. Persuasive Speech: 9-10 minutes with at least 4 reference（this may change due to student number, please double check with Prof Ned）



- Make a note to see how well the length of the speeches worked or did not
work after the first time this course is taught.


- See **Speech Sign-up Sheets** template. The dates and number of speakers
must be adjusted for each course by the Facilitator. The number of speakers
each class will depend the size of the class and the length of the speeches.


- The Facilitator should send the template to the instructor before the
students sign up so that the instructor can determine how many people can go
each day.


- If possible, you may want to make the speech presentation days longer
classes, but the other classes shorter.


- Facilitator to adjust dates and hand out to the students so they sign their
name to a slot. (This helps hold them accountable for the date of their
presentation.) The evaluators are the judges who will be critiquing the
speeches that day.] Note to students:


- **This is a contract.** You are committing to a date and you must make
your appointment. If you cannot make your timeslot, you *must* make
arrangements to switch with a peer. If this is not possible, because of
the time limits and number of students, you will not have the
opportunity to make up your speech. If this happens, you can get credit
for your outline (up to 8 marks), but *will not* get full marks for your
speech.


#### Speech Guidelines


- Review **Speech Guidelines** document with students during unit 4 (after the
icebreaker speech).


- Remind students that if they go more than 90 seconds over, you will cut them
off and students will lose marks for the conclusion.


- Make sure it is clear the students have to have at least 2 research cites
for the Demonstration Speech, 3 for the Informative Speech, and 4 for their
Persuasive Speech in each of the respective units.


#### Grading:


- The facilitator does not grade or mark the speeches. However, you have the
opportunity to give feedback about how the speech played in the room that
might not be captured via the camera and filming of the speeches. A simple
comment or checked box like Electrified the Room, Opened my eyes, Put me to
sleep, Dulled the moment, etc. In particular, make a note if the student
speaker connected well with the audience.


- Send these comments to the Instructor and/or add to the student feedback
form.   


- Always include the **student ID number** as well as the name with every
assessment/note to the instructor.


#### Recording & Submission


- You will need to record each speech and submit it to the professor.
Submission details TBD.


#### Speech Judging


- In addition to the instructor’s feedback of a speech, there will be peer
critiques done by three student judges who will take notes on each speech.
After all of the speeches have been delivered that day they will go outside
the classroom and share their notes and evaluations with each other and then
return to give their critique to each speechmakers. The goal is to have each
peer judge make at least one different constructive comment (what was done
wrong or what could be done better) and at least one encouraging comment
(what was done well) for each speaker.


- While the Speech Judges are outside doing their evaluation with each other,
the remaining students in the class who did not do a speech will break into
small groups and share their feedback and critiques with each other.


- Note to students that the judges for each speech must submit their feedback
and the number of cites they heard to the facilitator and the instructor
within 24 hours after the speech. Failure to do will result in a lost of
marks. The judges’ comments can be in a bullet point form (e.g., Had to many
distracting non-fluencies, or Communicated the main ideas well, or A great
introduction but lacked a conclusion, etc.)


- Each judge needs say in their evaluation how many cites they heard in the
speech (if they’re not sure, they should not count it). Emphasize that if
the judges didn’t hear the cite, it means it either wasn’t said well or they
didn’t have it.


- After the Speech Judges have come back to the classroom and shared their
critique, the small groups will be given the chance to offer feedback
comments (constructive and encouraging) that were not mentioned. Time
allowing.


- **Note**: The students delivering a speech do not have to do any critiquing
or evaluating on the day of their speech. Also, every student must do *at
least one* peer judging or they will lose 4 marks on their participation
grade.


- \*NOTE:\* The purpose of the critiquing is NOT to condemn or to shame
anyone, but rather to engage in a process designed to help each student grow
and develop during the course.


- Make a checklist to make sure all students have participated as Speech
Judges and have given Peer Feedback.


#### Self-Evaluation


- Note that students are asked to reflect on their own speeches in their
journals and submit a brief write-up to the instructor after each graded
speech. Refer to the Self-Evaluation guidelines.


- Remind students to not be too hard on themselves. They may be just beginning
and it takes a long time to master the art and craft of public speaking.



See Lesson Notes for more details on individual Units.


Facilitators are vital to this course. As flipped education, this course involves both online and in-class components. Facilitators play a key role because they interact with the students and can determine who is and who is not understanding material or having a good experience. Facilitators have latitude to focus on certain activities that they think are important at the moment. For example, the Facilitator might or might not want to have students volunteer to share what they wrote in their journal for a given activity.


# lesson notes and activities
The following are specific notes from the instructor about the units. Be sure to go to the Moodle site and review each unit in detail. You may want to ask students to complete certain activities before each class so they are prepared to participate.




For many of the activities in the online units, students are asked to write
their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner,
group or whole class, depending on the questions presented. E.g. Share with a
partner why you think public speaking is important.


### Unit 1


- The following exercises can help the students to overcome speech anxiety and
gain confidence in their ability to speak in front of others. It will also
help you and them to get to know your classmates.


- Everyone individually come to the front of the class and give a short
impromptu speech (one that is made up and delivered with no preparation).
E.g., tell the class your name, your favorite things to do, and your
favorite music and food and why. This should take one to two minutes.


- After each classmate finishes introducing his or her self the whole class
will clap, cheer, stomp their feet, and shout phrases like the following:
well done, bravo, loved it, etc. as a way to encourage the speaker.


- Optional: Form into groups of three or four and have a webquest competition
to see which group can find on the Internet the best tips and techniques for
overcoming shyness, nervousness, speech anxiety, etc. You will have five
minutes to do this and one person from each group will report on their
peer’s findings and the class will vote on the group that found the most
helpful strategies.


### Unit 2


- Emphasize Topic 3: How to Improve Listening Skills


- Taking notes on what is being said can aid the listening process. But don’t
try to take down every word. Listening too hard by writing down every small
detail can prevent us from absorbing the larger message. This is why we
should focus on the main ideas and their supporting evidence.


- Later in the course you will be given the opportunity to evaluate your class
members’ speeches. When it is time to do so come back to this section and
review it.


- We must not allow our emotions make us rush to judgement that what is being
said is all good or all bad. Snap conclusions are a sure way to short
circuit the listening and understanding process.

- Which of these speech topics is ethical and which are not and why:


> \- “How to Hack Computers.”


> \- “How to protect against hacking.”


> \- “Why Getting Proper Sleep is Important for University Students.”


> \- “Practical Tips for Fruitful Dating.”


> \- “How to download Hollywood Movies for Free.”


> \- “How to Take Revenge on Someone Who Has Hurt You.”


> \- “How to Find and Pay for Informative Speeches on the Internet.”


- Next, ask students to come up with three ethical and three unethical speech
topics and decide why they are so. Ask them to present one to their
classmates for student debate and discussion.


### Unit 3:


- Let students know what day they will deliver their Ice-Breaker speeches. You
will choose the order of who will go first, second, third, etc.


- Before the speeches, go over the guidelines for audience participation and
reactions. Participation includes active listening skills and no
distractions. Reactions include clapping, stomping the floor, shouting out
praise such as great job, congratulations you did it, you wowed us, etc.
Encourage students to try out these types of praise, even if they’re not
comfortable doing so.


- As noted, the goal is to make this first speech a memorable positive
experience – for both the speaker and the audience.


- Let students know after the Ice-Breaker speech that there will be an awards
ceremony at the end of the course. Refer to the award list and ask students
to make a note in their journals after each speech in the unit as to who
should be nominated for an award.


### Unit 4


- Suggested time one 75 min. class


- Point out Topic 3: Techniques for Using Language Effectively


- Use appropriate language. Swearing, cursing, and profane and obscene
language are not proper for a public speech unless they are vital to the
topic or are used to illustrate a point. Many people are offended by
such language and you can turn them off and harm your credibility if you
use such language when it is not called for. The same can be said for
sexist language and racial and ethnic slurs. Some language is so
powerful and defaming that you will instantly lose your audience when
you use it. Your particular cultural and ethnic context will also
determine this, something that you can discuss with your Facilitator.


- Tongue-twisters: Have an in-class competition to see who can say all of
these clearly without a single mistake


- Articulation and Enunciation Exercises: Have volunteers stand before the
class and do some of them out loud. Make this fun. It is not a time to judge
but a time to grow together.


Activity: find a beautifully written poem that speaks to you and practice reciting it out loud. Listen closely to the power of the language and reflect on how it emotionally moves you and why.
You can find this poem in your native language


add a tongue-twister in your native language and share during your live sessions


### Unit 5


- Suggested one two 75 min. class


- This unit is divided into the following topics:

Finding the Right Speech Topic and Its Purpose
Researching and Supporting the Central Idea
Crafting a Strong Introduction
Organizing the Main Body of Your Speech
Crafting an Effective Conclusion
Outlining Your Speech

Share the outline template with student and give them an example.
Activity: ask students to come up with one of two topics they may want to speak on.


### Unit 6

This unit is divided into the following topics:

Creating and Using Presentation Aids
Speech Delivery Techniques
Enunciation, Articulation, and Pronunciation Practice

- Prepare students for speeches starting next week. Go over guidelines.
Specifics about demonstrations speeches will be in Unit 7.


### Unit 7


- Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
of students and term schedule)

 and how that experience can help you create and deliver a strong
informative speech. Be prepared to share your thoughts with your Facilitator and
classmates.


- Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.


Study chapters 23.4 and 24.4, 24.5 as you create your preparation outline and be sure to submit it to your teacher before you speak. This is very important and mandatory. 

Before the speeches, please study the Informative_Speech_Evaluation&Feedback_Form

### Unit 8

- Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
of students and term schedule)

as you create your preparation outline and be sure to submit it to your teacher before you speak. This is very important and mandatory. 

- After each speech, students should have written in their journals who
the best speeches were given by. Before they vote, ask them to
review their notes.
