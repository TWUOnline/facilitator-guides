**Course Policies:**
--------------------

### Missed Speech Day Policy:

>   Please be ready for your scheduled day. If you miss your day for any reason
>   besides severe illness or other extenuating circumstances, you will be
>   required to speak at the tail end of all other speeches, and you will
>   receive an automatic reduction of 15 points. This is a gracious policy
>   compared to the consequences of not being ready for a life speech. Please
>   contact the Facilitator immediately when you feel you are unable to speak
>   (for whatever reason).

### **Long or Short Speech Policy:**

>   What happens if you go significantly short or long on your speech? It’s hard
>   to provide a cut-and-dry rule because some ‘too short’ speeches are very
>   good in all other respects, and some ‘long speeches’ have terrific ‘added
>   value.’ But the general rule is that for every one minute short or long, 3
>   points are deducted from your score. This respects the cultural expectation
>   that speaking events last certain lengths of time, and it guarantees
>   everyone who signed up to speak that day is allowed to (i.e., no one gets
>   bumped due to three long speakers!)

### Inclusive Classroom:

>   TWU is committed to an ethic of inclusion centred on the principles of
>   hospitality, reciprocity and reconciliation. We seek to produce generous
>   learning spaces that are based on respect for difference and are open to
>   diverse views, opinions, and identities. We welcome and value all voices,
>   including those that have been silenced on account of race, religious
>   beliefs, colour, gender, physical or mental variations, age, ancestry, place
>   of origin, marital status, family status, sex, and sexual orientation, or on
>   any other grounds identified in applicable human rights law.

## Class Activities

The following sections outline key information you will need to plan and facilitate this course.
**Note that once you have mapped out the course (specific units to
dates), send the updated syllabus to the instructor.**

Course Resources
================

-   The course textbook is: *A Concise Public Speaking Handbook*, 5th edition.
    Students will need to access the text online at:
    <https://revel.pearson.com/#/courses/5c657df8e4b0382938d71581/toc>. Students
    must have online access initially to get the text, and then the course
    materials can be downloaded to a phone/table app if desired.

-   IMPORTANT NOTE: The units of this course dovetail well with the chapters of
    the assigned textbook. Students must study both the units and the assigned
    chapters from the course text. Sometimes the material will overlap, but
    often the unit material and the chapter material will support and augment
    each other.

-   Before you begin each unit, encourage students to skim the sections of the
    required chapter. Then, read the unit on Moodle (e.g. topics, learning
    activities). Before they complete any unit assessments, they must read the
    required chapters in full and do the short quizzes.

-   Remind students to take notes! The online text also has useful resources to
    help you study. Be sure to watch the videos. This process will reinforce
    what they are learning and help them do well in the course.

-   Facilitators will have access to the online textbook, in case they want to
    make notes, highlight content, etc.

**Online Learning Activities**
==============================

-   **Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that
    will be discussed that week. They need to read the textbook chapters, the
    overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning
    activities.**

-   **Online learning activities include questions that we ask students to
    answer in a Reflective Journal, videos that explain topics further, and an
    ungraded key terms quiz.**

-   **As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that
    they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal
    due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor
    on Moodle by Friday.**

**In-class Learning Activities**
================================

### **Discussions**

-   **In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about.
    As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would
    inspire an engaging group/class discussion.**

-   Students are encouraged to bring their **Reflective Journal** to class, as
    it has notes from the online activities. Choose which topics they can share
    with partner/group. Encourage them to add reflections to journal after the
    class. Point out journal submission dates (after Units 1, 2, 4, 10). 

### **Key Terms Review Activities**

-   Units 1, 2, 4, and 5 explain key terms that students need to know for the
    midterm. Students are encouraged do quizzes online, but you may want to have
    some vocabulary activities or study skills exercises in class (if there is
    time).

-   Note that there are unit quizzes in Moodle (H5P) as well as the Revel
    quizzes (online textbook)

### **Midterm**

-   There will be a midterm after Unit 6. Be sure to tell students that they
    should know all of the terms and concepts covered in the course units 1-6
    and have practiced all of the short quizzes in the units, as this will help
    them do well on the exam.

-   The midterm will be 30 multiple choice questions and students will have 1
    hour to complete the exam.

### **Speech Practice:**

-   Students will deliver speeches in Units 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Be sure to give
    them at least one class to practice with a partner, and then depending on
    your timeline, how many students, etc., you will need to plan out how many
    additional classes you will need for the presentations and feedback.

### **Speech Presentations**

#### Timing:

-   Speeches in class: Confirm time limits for each speech with Instructor. This
    depends on the length of the course, contact hours and number of students.
    Average for speeches:

1.  Non-graded “ice-breaker” speech: 3-4 minutes

2.  Demonstration Speech: 4-5 minutes

3.  Informative Speech: 6-7 minutes

4.  Persuasive Speech: 9-10 minutes

5.  Non-graded Awards Speech: 5 minutes

-   Make a note to see how well the length of the speeches worked or did not
    work after the first time this course is taught.

-   See **Speech Sign-up Sheets** template. The dates and number of speakers
    must be adjusted for each course by the Facilitator. The number of speakers
    each class will depend the size of the class and the length of the speeches.

-   The Facilitator should send the template to the instructor before the
    students sign up so that the instructor can determine how many people can go
    each day.

-   If possible, you may want to make the speech presentation days longer
    classes, but the other classes shorter.

-   Facilitator to adjust dates and hand out to the students so they sign their
    name to a slot. (This helps hold them accountable for the date of their
    presentation.) The evaluators are the judges who will be critiquing the
    speeches that day.] Note to students:

    -   **This is a contract.** You are committing to a date and you must make
        your appointment. If you cannot make your timeslot, you *must* make
        arrangements to switch with a peer. If this is not possible, because of
        the time limits and number of students, you will not have the
        opportunity to make up your speech. If this happens, you can get credit
        for your outline (up to 8 marks), but *will not* get full marks for your
        speech.

#### Speech Guidelines

-   Review **Speech Guidelines** document with students during unit 4 (after the
    icebreaker speech).

-   Remind students that if they go more than 90 seconds over, you will cut them
    off and students will lose marks for the conclusion.

-   Make sure it is clear the students have to have at least 2 research cites
    for the Demonstration Speech, 3 for the Informative Speech, and 4 for their
    Persuasive Speech in each of the respective units.

#### Grading:

-   The facilitator does not grade or mark the speeches. However, you have the
    opportunity to give feedback about how the speech played in the room that
    might not be captured via the camera and filming of the speeches. A simple
    comment or checked box like Electrified the Room, Opened my eyes, Put me to
    sleep, Dulled the moment, etc. In particular, make a note if the student
    speaker connected well with the audience.

-   Send these comments to the Instructor and/or add to the student feedback
    form.   

-   Always include the **student ID number** as well as the name with every
    assessment/note to the instructor.

#### Recording & Submission

-   You will need to record each speech and submit it to the professor.
    Submission details TBD.

#### Speech Judging

-   In addition to the instructor’s feedback of a speech, there will be peer
    critiques done by three student judges who will take notes on each speech.
    After all of the speeches have been delivered that day they will go outside
    the classroom and share their notes and evaluations with each other and then
    return to give their critique to each speechmakers. The goal is to have each
    peer judge make at least one different constructive comment (what was done
    wrong or what could be done better) and at least one encouraging comment
    (what was done well) for each speaker.

-   While the Speech Judges are outside doing their evaluation with each other,
    the remaining students in the class who did not do a speech will break into
    small groups and share their feedback and critiques with each other.

-   Note to students that the judges for each speech must submit their feedback
    and the number of cites they heard to the facilitator and the instructor
    within 24 hours after the speech. Failure to do will result in a lost of
    marks. The judges’ comments can be in a bullet point form (e.g., Had to many
    distracting non-fluencies, or Communicated the main ideas well, or A great
    introduction but lacked a conclusion, etc.)

-   Each judge needs say in their evaluation how many cites they heard in the
    speech (if they’re not sure, they should not count it). Emphasize that if
    the judges didn’t hear the cite, it means it either wasn’t said well or they
    didn’t have it.

-   After the Speech Judges have come back to the classroom and shared their
    critique, the small groups will be given the chance to offer feedback
    comments (constructive and encouraging) that were not mentioned. Time
    allowing.

-   **Note**: The students delivering a speech do not have to do any critiquing
    or evaluating on the day of their speech. Also, every student must do *at
    least one* peer judging or they will lose 4 marks on their participation
    grade.

-   \*NOTE:\* The purpose of the critiquing is NOT to condemn or to shame
    anyone, but rather to engage in a process designed to help each student grow
    and develop during the course.

-   Make a checklist to make sure all students have participated as Speech
    Judges and have given Peer Feedback.

#### Self-Evaluation

-   Note that students are asked to reflect on their own speeches in their
    journals and submit a brief write-up to the instructor after each graded
    speech. Refer to the Self-Evaluation guidelines.

-   Remind students to not be too hard on themselves. They may be just beginning
    and it takes a long time to master the art and craft of public speaking.

#### Celebration Speech Presentations

-   For the Unit 10 celebration speeches – make it a party! Ask students to
    bring food, non-alcoholic drinks, invite family and friends.

-   Initiation to family and friends should be relative to the venue (try to
    book an auditorium)

-   If there is time and you feel comfortable doing so, feel free to give an
    encouraging comment about each student.

-   The Facilitator will need to print the awards on a thick paper stock (good
    quality). See **template** provided. This should be signed by the
    Facilitator, and use a handwriting font for the instructor’s signature (e.g.
    Ned Vankevich, Ph.D)


See Lesson Notes for more details on individual Units.

Facilitators are vital to this course. As flipped education, this course involves both online and in-class components. Facilitators play a key role because they interact with the students and can determine who is and who is not understanding material or having a good experience. Facilitators have latitude to focus on certain activities that they think are important at the moment. For example, the Facilitator might or might not want to have students volunteer to share what they wrote in their journal for a given activity.

# lesson notes and activities
The following are specific notes from the instructor about the units.  Be sure to go to the Moodle site and review each unit in detail.  You may want to ask students to complete certain activities before each class so they are prepared to participate.


For many of the activities in the online units, students are asked to write
their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner,
group or whole class, depending on the questions presented. E.g. Share with a
partner why you think public speaking is important.

### Unit 1

-   The following exercises can help the students to overcome speech anxiety and
    gain confidence in their ability to speak in front of others. It will also
    help you and them to get to know your classmates.

-   Everyone individually come to the front of the class and give a short
    impromptu speech (one that is made up and delivered with no preparation).
    E.g., tell the class your name, your favorite things to do, and your
    favorite music and food and why. This should take one to two minutes.

-   After each classmate finishes introducing his or her self the whole class
    will clap, cheer, stomp their feet, and shout phrases like the following:
    well done, bravo, loved it, etc. as a way to encourage the speaker.

-   Optional: Form into groups of three or four and have a webquest competition
    to see which group can find on the Internet the best tips and techniques for
    overcoming shyness, nervousness, speech anxiety, etc. You will have five
    minutes to do this and one person from each group will report on their
    peer’s findings and the class will vote on the group that found the most
    helpful strategies.

### Unit 2

-   Emphasize Topic 3: How to Improve Listening Skills

-   Taking notes on what is being said can aid the listening process. But don’t
    try to take down every word. Listening too hard by writing down every small
    detail can prevent us from absorbing the larger message. This is why we
    should focus on the main ideas and their supporting evidence.

-   Later in the course you will be given the opportunity to evaluate your class
    members’ speeches. When it is time to do so come back to this section and
    review it.

-   We must not allow our emotions make us rush to judgement that what is being
    said is all good or all bad. Snap conclusions are a sure way to short
    circuit the listening and understanding process.

-   Activity 2.6: Share what it means to be an ethical public speaker and why it
    is important. Consider also how ethical speaking can help you and your
    society.

-   Activity 2.7: Plagiarism: Put the students in groups and ask them to answer
    the following question and share their responses with their classmates.

    -   Which of these speech topics is ethical and which are not and why:

>   \- “How to Hack Computers.”

>   \- “How to protect against hacking.”

>   \- “Why Getting Proper Sleep is Important for University Students.”

>   \- “Practical Tips for Fruitful Dating.”

>   \- “How to download Hollywood Movies for Free.”

>   \- “How to Take Revenge on Someone Who Has Hurt You.”

>   \- “How to Find and Pay for Informative Speeches on the Internet.”

-   Next, ask students to come up with three ethical and three unethical speech
    topics and decide why they are so. Ask them to present one to their
    classmates for student debate and discussion.

### Unit 3:

-   Let students know what day they will deliver their Ice-Breaker speeches. You
    will choose the order of who will go first, second, third, etc.

-   Before the speeches, go over the guidelines for audience participation and
    reactions. Participation includes active listening skills and no
    distractions. Reactions include clapping, stomping the floor, shouting out
    praise such as great job, congratulations you did it, you wowed us, etc.
    Encourage students to try out these types of praise, even if they’re not
    comfortable doing so.

-   As noted, the goal is to make this first speech a memorable positive
    experience – for both the speaker and the audience.

-   Let students know after the Ice-Breaker speech that there will be an awards
    ceremony at the end of the course. Refer to the award list and ask students
    to make a note in their journals after each speech in the unit as to who
    should be nominated for an award.

### Unit 4

-   Suggested time two 75 min. classes

-   Point out Topic 3: Techniques for Using Language Effectively

    -   Use appropriate language. Swearing, cursing, and profane and obscene
        language are not proper for a public speech unless they are vital to the
        topic or are used to illustrate a point. Many people are offended by
        such language and you can turn them off and harm your credibility if you
        use such language when it is not called for. The same can be said for
        sexist language and racial and ethnic slurs. Some language is so
        powerful and defaming that you will instantly lose your audience when
        you use it. Your particular cultural and ethnic context will also
        determine this, something that you can discuss with your Facilitator.

-   Tongue-twisters: Have an in-class competition to see who can say all of
    these clearly without a single mistake

-   Articulation and Enunciation Exercises: Have volunteers stand before the
    class and do some of them out loud. Make this fun. It is not a time to judge
    but a time to grow together.

### Unit 5

-   Suggested time two 75 min. classes

-   Go over the Interviewing Guidelines document with students.

### Unit 6

-   Prepare students for speeches starting next week. Go over guidelines.
    Specifics about demonstrations speeches will be in Unit 7.

### Unit 7

-   This class will take 2-3 weeks, depending on your term schedule.

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   Activity 7.1: Ask students to share their differences with a peer.

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.


### Unit 8

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   This can be important activity to cover in class: Activity 8.1: Comparing and Contrasting Demonstration and Informative Speeches

* Reflect on what you learned from your demonstration speech (the good and the
bad) and how that experience can help you create and deliver a strong
informative speech. Be prepared to share your thoughts with your Facilitator and
classmates.

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.

### Unit 9

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.

-   Ask students to send their list of who deserves which award to the
    Facilitator and Instructor by the end of Unit 9.

    -   After each speech, students should have written in their journals who
        the best speeches were given by. Before they vote, ask them to
        review their notes.

-   TBD: Online vote or paper?
•	The Facilitator will need to print the awards on a thick paper stock (good quality). See template provided. This should be signed by the Facilitator, and use a handwriting font for the instructor’s signature (e.g. Ned Vankevich, Ph.D)
