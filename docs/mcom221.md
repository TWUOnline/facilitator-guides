# Course Overview and Syllabus

### Course Overview for MCOM 221

!! The syllabus includes key information about the course schedule, assignments, and policies. Please read the full course syllabus in Moodle.

## Course Description
This introductory course in the art and craft of digital video production familiarizes students with the “classical” approach to cinematic aesthetics and techniques. Students work individually and collaboratively as they produce, shoot, and edit short films. Emphasis is placed on analyzing films from a filmmaker’s perspective.  

### Course Specifics
Motion picture and single camera film production have undergone major changes during the “digital revolution.”  Today more people have access to inexpensive high-end film gear than ever before. However, this does not mean the quality of productions has increased along with the quantity of great looking productions. To help remedy this situation, this course will introduce students to the seminal visual language, aesthetics, poetics, and techniques that enhance filmmaking.  As such, it will involve both a theoretical and an applied, or “hands-on,” approach to digital filmmaking.  In addition, students will be introduced to the process of critiquing film from a film artist’s perspective with an aim toward helping students gain confidence in the conceptual, narrative, and practical applications of digital-based film production.  Students will also be given the opportunity to work in creative, collaborative teams to produce several short video pieces as they face the multiple challenges of making excellent short films.



## Course Learning Outcomes:
After successfully completing the course, you will be able to:

1. Execute  high quality still and moving visual compositions

## Required Texts and Materials

- Vankevich, Ned. *Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft*. Epub.
- All other resources will be provided online.

# **Online Learning Activities**

  - Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week. They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.

  - Online learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal, videos that explain topics further, and links to helpful Internet resources in both the Units and the course text.

  - As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

# **In-class Learning Activities**

### Discussions

  - In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about. As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would inspire an engaging group/class discussion.

  - Students are encouraged to bring their **Reflective Journal** to class, as it has notes from the online activities and their responses to the course material and peer projects. Choose which topics they can share with a partner/group. Encourage them to add reflections to their journal after the class.  

  - Guidelines for how to pitch will be provided for the course.

### Project Pitches: and Team Collaboration

  - **Students will pitch their projects to their peers and present the title, genre, and a brief synopsis of the Montage and Final Film they want to do. Students can also ask if anyone in the class would like to join them on their project.**

  - **However, it is vital to stress that the workload must be equal. That is, that one person must not do all of the work. It should be a true collaboration as the students in the teams decide who will write, produce, direct, shoot, and edit the projects.**

  - Those wanting to work in teams must get permission from the instructor to ensure that the size of the project justifies collaboration and that the workload is equally shared. The students will send a written copy of the pitch and a description of who will be doing what on the project.

#### Grading:

  - The facilitator does not grade or mark the exercises and projects. However, you have the opportunity to give feedback about the student’s work. This can be in the form of a simple comment or checked box. For example,the student’s film Electrified the Room, Opened my eyes, Put me to sleep, Dulled the moment, Inspired me, Made me laugh or afraid, etc. In particular, make a note if the student’s project connected well with the audience (you observe that audience responded to it positively **or identified with the material)**

  - Send these comments to the Instructor and/or add to the student feedback form.   

  - Always include the **student ID number** as well as the name with every assessment/note to the instructor.

#### Self-Evaluation

  - Note that students are asked to reflect on their own projects in their journals. Refer to the Self-Evaluation guidelines.

<!-- end list -->

  - Remind students to not be too hard on themselves. They may be just beginning and it takes a long time to master the art and craft of public speaking.

<!--
#### Celebration Speech Presentations

  - **For the Unit 10 celebration session – make it a party\! Ask students to bring food, non-alcoholic drinks, invite family and friends.**

  - **Invitations to family and friends should be relative to the venue (try to book an auditorium)**

  - If there is time and you feel comfortable doing so, feel free to give an encouraging comment about each student.

  - The Facilitator will need to print the awards for Best Short Film, Best Montage, Most Improved Film, etc. on a thick paper stock (good quality). See **template** provided. This should be signed by the Facilitator, and use a handwriting font for the instructor’s signature (e.g. Ned Vankevich, Ph.D)

  - Be sure to go to the Moodle site and review each unit and corresponding learning outcomes in detail. You may want to ask students to complete certain activities before each class so they are prepared to participate.

  - For many of the activities in the online units, students are asked to write their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner, group or whole class, depending on the questions presented. E.g. Share with a partner why you think public speaking is important.
